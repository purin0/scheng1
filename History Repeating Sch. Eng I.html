<div style="text-align:center; font-family:Monospace;color:white;"> A Multigenre Project on War and Political Repression </div>
<h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:Monospace"> Kai V. </h2>
<article id="dearReader"> <div id="starting"> Dear Reader, <br> <div style="text-align:left;"> &emsp;More than ever is it important that we stay aware of what is going on in our world. In many ways, our present state is much better than how it was 100+ years ago. However, this does not mean that international affairs have gotten any better. This does not mean that we are suddenly incapable of cruel and inhumane actions against our own kind.
<br>
&emsp; I chose to do my project on war and political repression, because I find it more important now than ever in history for us to understand the how and the why of these concepts. I vividly recall as a kid sitting and watching news of things like war and protests on TV, and feeling a sense of dread growing in the pit of my stomach. This is the world that I, and many other people of my generation have grown up in and have always known. It’s easy for some to sit back and watch as these kinds of events happen, or even think in naivety that we are past these kinds of things. None of that means that we shouldn’t continue learning about it, or that we should grow unaware of them in our world due to ignorance or growing “numb.”
<br>
&emsp;I hope to accomplish exactly that in this project. By the end of this, I hope that you understand war and repression a bit more than you did before reading. I hope that, with that knowledge, you can have a deeper understanding of past and current events.

  <i style="font-size:14px;"> ― The Armenian Genocide was the mass killing of Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire from 1915-1916. Many scholars estimate that anywhere from half, to over 2/3 of the population was killed. Before WWI, there were 1.5-2 million Armenians in the empire. Within about a year, there were less than 400,000. Rape and beatings were commonplace.There were several massacres of Armenians following up to the genocide, and even a reprise in the 1920s. To this day, there is still a lasting impact due to the horrors of this mass genocide.</i> </div>

<h3> Flashes of Their Reality </h3>



<p class="poem"> .1
<br>
a single tear is shed from the eye of the oppressed <br>
his life drained from between his own fingers<br>
no fight to fight back, no will to keep going<br>
his life dedicated to his one purpose, labeled by a greater one<br>
dirt on his face and mud caked on his hands, <br>
knowing that his screams reply with no help<br>
wandering a barren wasteland, bandaging their hope<br>
dew dripping from the leaves of desperation<br>
akin to the wet leaving from his eye <br>
stomachs so empty they have forgotten how to feel full<br>
finding a way to cope with the way things are, <br>
praying this won’t be all they know until they die<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
one thousand yards away he stares<br>
and he will wonder what he is looking for<br>
maybe in those thousand yards away<br>
he will find the reason he is here today<br>
wielding pure evil in his hands, his heart<br>
spitting fire from his hands and hauling <br>
destruction in his pockets, maybe then<br>
he can find his wandering faith in war
<br>
<br>
.3
<br>
they are the reason we are here today,<br>
and we whole heartedly believe this; so<br>
we hunt them down like hungry dogs<br>
flinging spit and drool as we chase<br> 
we rip them apart and seek our truth<br>
payback for the downfall we endured<br>
in the aftermath of the endless chase,<br>
when our teeth are stained red and <br> 
their hide in our arms; with every one <br>
of them gone <br>
do we think we are done.

  <i style="font-size:14px;"> ― The Khmer Rouge was responsible for, perhaps, some of the most severe forms of repression in history. Even the most basic of human rights were stripped from its citizens, and they were subject to extreme cruelty if they did not comply with their rules and laws. One notable place where thousands were killed was the S-21 prison. Out of 14,000 prisoners, only about 12 survived. Millions of Cambodia's own people were slaughtered under the control of the regime. To put into perspective on how recent these atrocities were committed; the Khmer Rouge regime was taken down by the Vietnamese in only 1979.</i> </div>

<h3 style="text-align:right;"> Political Repression: An Overview </h3>

<p class="essay"> 



In the modern era, where conflict is rife and international relations are less than favorable, we have to look to the atrocities of modern day governments worldwide. We think of ourselves as being more civilized and advanced than we were in the past. Compared to, say, WWII, or the conditions leading up to and during the French Revolution. However, that belief is biased. Let’s take a look at political repression and why it’s so important and relevant to talk about today.<br>
<br>
Firstly, we must understand what political repression is and how it has taken form in the past, as well as how it current takes form now. Then, we will take a look at how political repression affects us. <br>
<br>
What is political repression? In simple terms, it is where a state entity represses, or inhibits the freedoms and rights of, its citizens forcefully. Of course, as the phrase suggests, it is for political reasons. Acts of political repression can include the stripping of a group’s rights, torture, summary executions and extrajudical killings, and more. Governments which repress their populace do so in order to control their citizens. <br>
<br>
The concept of political repression has a lot of nuance that is needed to truly understand the weight of it. To understand what it is a bit better, we should take a look at political repression in the past. <br>
<br>
During the reign of Stalin, the Soviet Union utilized political oppression as part of its authoritarian regime. Anti-soviet expression was swiftly and severely punished, religion was not tolerated, and over all, the individual liberties of Russian citizens was inhibited. Their lives and purpose was reduced to being a worker for the USSR. <br>
<br>
Another example is of Nazi Germany. In Nazi Germany, similarly, any citizen who wasn’t doing what the Nazis wanted would’ve been punished. Freedom of speech, especially politically, was inhibited. They saw individualism as something that would’ve corroded the culture and the community of the nation. They did not accept any dissent or opposition. Of course, you can’t talk about the Nazis and repression without mentioning the Holocaust. People who the Nazis didn’t like or thought as inferior were sent to concentration camps without any regard to their rights. Groups like the Jewish, homosexuals, black people, the Roma, disabled people, and more. <br>
<br>
Now, we clearly see what political repression looked like in history. Now, we can start to see how political repression can manifest in our modern day world. <br>
<br>
Eritrea, for example, is a country that practices repression in extreme ways. According to Amnesty International, “Government critics outside the country are often harassed, intimidated or even threatened by members of the government’s party (the only party permitted to operate in Eritrea).” The country has been known to commit serious crimes for a long time, however, September 18th of 2001 was a remarkable turning point, as the government began its campaign of repression and censorship that continues to this day. <br>
<br>
Another present day example of repression is in Cuba. According to the World Report, the government harrasses and intimidates any dissidents. People are often arrested/detained without a warrant; and are treated horrifically in detention. Reporters who speak about protests, or protesters themselves, were sometimes beaten or treated poorly over all, whilst being held incommunicado. All media is controlled by the government in Cuba and outside media is restricted. Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Cuba. Cubans who speak out against the government are at risk of prosecution and are not protected by due process. The government also can refuse people to exit and enter the country for any reason, leaving people in dire situations; especially human rights defenders and influencers like bloggers. To this day, Cuba is a country with prevalent human rights issues and repression. <br>
<br>
When we look back at history, we shake our head and promise that it will never happen again.<br>
<br>
However, when we take a look at the state of the world today, we must ask ourselves, did we really fufill that promise? Chances are, the answer of many to that question is no. <br>
<br>
It is imperative that we truly learn from history. It is imperative that we don’t repeat the same mistakes again. We, as a species, understand the horrors that we are capable of. We have rendered our own species in states of despair that we cannot comprehend. In order to fight against these acts of repression, we must be proactive. We must realize what is going on, and how it mirrors the horrors of history. <br>

  <i style="font-size:14px;"> ― The Taiping Rebellion was a civil war in China that lasted for 14 years. It is considered to be one of the most deadly wars ever, with death tolls in the 20-50 millions. This war rivals the bloodshed of WWII. Yet, we rarely do hear about it. The effects of the rebellion affect China to this day, and is considered by many scholars to be the most important event in 19th century China. </i>

<h3> The Life of Perpetrators </h3>
<article class="biography">

<p> Little is known about Kim Jong-Un when he was younger. In his young adulthood, he began to rapidly climb the ladder in North Korea’s government. He gained power quickly and began to be referred to very highly in the country. After his father, Kim Jong Il, passed, he was given the title of the country’s supreme leader. Early in his reign, he exerted his power strongly and also put extensive effort into accelerating North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. The regime under his power is shrouded in secrecy. Even though we know a few things about the happenings of North Korea, the amount we know is minuscule compared to the bigger picture. Stories of executions/killings of citizens over tiny crimes, severe famine and forced labor, and more come from his country. To this day, not that much is known about him. </p>

<p> The early years of Adolf Hitler were full of discontent. He was a moody, temperamental child, and his life was full of anguish. He had resentment for his father and was deeply attached to his mother, whose death shattered him in his adolescence. He had dreams of becoming a painter, which were also shattered after his rejection from the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts. In the years afterward, he changed fundamentally. He grew a deep hatred for Jews, liberalism, Marxists, and other groups. In WWI, he was temporarily blinded and sent to prison. His rage spiraled into further hatred, and his actions to avenge Germany led to the outbreak of WWII. His powerful oratory made him a powerful leader. He was responsible for millions of deaths in WWII and the rise of a dangerous political ideology. However, in the decline of the Nazis, and as the Allied forces began to corner Germany, he committed suicide. His impact on the world is immense, still lasting to this day. </p>
<p>

Maximillian Robespierre lived a relatively good life growing up, and worked as a lawyer. He was one of the primary leaders of the French Revolution. His political career began quickly as tensions in France grew. His fiery oratorical skills made him known as the Incorruptible. His goal was not to appeal to fellow deputies, but to the people. This made him immensely popular. After the new French Constitution was adopted, this didn’t end. The 1790s were an era of immense chaos and entropy in France. Many could argue that much of it was in his hands. As part of the Committee of Public Safety, Robespierre was part of France’s Reign of Terror. Thousands were killed, hundreds of thousands were arrested under any suspicion. His fiery wrath started off noble at the start of the revolution, but ultimately ended in his demise. His own peers decided to strike him frist in order to avoid becoming a victim of his wrath. In his last days, a bullet shattered his jaw, and he was executed by gulliotine; the way that those thousands killed were. He was for the people, and executed by the people.</p>

  <i style="font-size:14px;"> ― The Global War on Terror (usually known as just the war on terror) was an American-led campaign against terrorism globally. The campaign began after the attacks on the Twin Towers on September 11th. The campaign had a massive scope, spanning several wars, including the Afghanistan war. The effect of the campaign is significant, with impacts both negative and positive in the world.

  McCarthyism, also known as the Second Red Scare, was a campaign of political repression against supposed Communist infiltrators in the government. Senator Joseph McCarthy launched many investigations and threw accusations against government officials. These actions intensified tensions back home in the Cold War. His actions led to several officials losing their jobs, but also the formation of the term McCarthyism, that still holds significance to this day. </i> </div>
